# Stock Price and News Notifier ðŸ“ˆðŸ“°

This project is a stock price and news notification system that automatically monitors specified stock price changes and sends relevant news articles via email. It's designed for users interested in staying informed on stock movements and related news, all from a simple, automated service.

## Project Overview
The program tracks a specified stock (in this case, Tesla, Inc. - TSLA) and checks for price fluctuations. If the stock price changes by more than a specified percentage (e.g., 5%), the system fetches relevant news articles about the company and emails them to the user. This keeps the user informed of both financial and related news updates in real-time.

## Features
- **Stock Price Monitoring**: Uses [Twelve Data API](https://twelvedata.com/) to fetch daily stock data.
- **News Fetching**: Retrieves relevant news articles from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) when there are significant stock changes.
- **Automated Notifications**: Sends email notifications containing stock change information and top related news articles.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for script development.
- **APIs**: 
  - **Twelve Data API**: For fetching stock price data.
  - **NewsAPI**: For retrieving relevant news articles.
- **SMTP**: For sending email notifications.
- **dotenv**: To securely manage sensitive information through environment variables.
- **AWS Lambda (Optional)**: Can be configured for serverless execution and automation.
